Key Features
User Authentication: Upon entering the chat, users can choose a username or join as a guest. This feature enhances personalization and allows users to identify each other easily.

Real-Time Messaging: The application uses WebSockets to enable real-time communication. Messages sent by one user are instantly displayed to all connected users, creating a seamless chat experience.

Typing Indicators: Users can see when others are typing, which adds a layer of interactivity to the chat. This feature helps users know when to expect a response.

User List: The sidebar displays a list of online users, allowing participants to see who is currently active in the chat. This feature enhances community engagement and interaction.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Dynamic Message Display: Messages are displayed in a visually appealing manner, with different styles for messages sent by the user and those sent by others. This differentiation helps users quickly identify their messages.

Theme Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark themes, providing a customizable user experience that caters to individual preferences.

Animation Effects: The application includes subtle animations for message entry and typing indicators, enhancing the overall user experience.

User Interface
The user interface is divided into several key components:

Header: Displays the application title and connection status. It also includes a button to toggle between light and dark themes.

Sidebar: Shows the list of online users and the current user's information. This sidebar is hidden on smaller screens to maximize chat space.

Message Container: The main area where messages are displayed. It features a scrollable view that allows users to navigate through chat history easily.

Typing Indicators: A dedicated area that shows which users are currently typing, enhancing the interactive feel of the chat.

Message Input: A text input field where users can type their messages, accompanied by a send button for easy message submission.

Technical Implementation
The application is built using standard web technologies:

HTML: The structure of the application is defined using HTML, which organizes the various components of the chat interface.

CSS: Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling, providing a modern and clean look. Custom CSS is also included for animations and specific styles.

JavaScript: The application logic is implemented in JavaScript, handling user interactions, WebSocket communication, and dynamic updates to the user interface.

WebSocket: A mock WebSocket server is used to simulate real-time messaging. In a production environment, this would connect to a real WebSocket server to handle message broadcasting and user management.
